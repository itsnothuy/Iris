# Model Management Specification

## Business Goals

Provide a seamless experience for discovering, downloading, managing, and optimizing AI models on Android devices. Users should be able to easily switch between models based on their needs (speed vs. quality) while understanding the trade-offs and system impact.

**Primary Objectives**:
- Simplify model discovery and acquisition for users
- Enable efficient model switching without app restarts
- Provide clear information about model capabilities and resource requirements
- Optimize storage and memory usage for multiple models

    val averageLatencyMs: Long,
    val memoryUsageMB: Int,
    val batteryImpactScore: Int // 1-10 scale
)
```

**Download State**:
```kotlin
sealed class DownloadState {
    object NotDownloaded : DownloadState()
    data class Downloading(val progress: Float, val speedBytesPerSec: Long) : DownloadState()
    object Downloaded : DownloadState()
    data class Error(val message: String) : DownloadState()

```

### Repository Pattern

```kotlin
interface ModelRepository {
    suspend fun getAvailableModels(): List<ModelInfo>
    suspend fun getInstalledModels(): List<ModelInfo>
    suspend fun downloadModel(modelId: String): Flow<DownloadState>
    suspend fun deleteModel(modelId: String)

- Test cleanup and optimization operations
- Validate storage calculations across devices

## Telemetry **NOT** Collected

In alignment with privacy-first principles:

❌ **Model Usage Patterns**: No tracking of which models users prefer  
❌ **Download Behavior**: No analytics on download times or failures  
❌ **Performance Metrics**: No inference speed or efficiency data transmitted  
❌ **Device Information**: No hardware specifications or capabilities shared  
❌ **Model Content**: No model outputs or generated content  
❌ **User Preferences**: No configuration choices or settings  

**Local Analytics Only**: Performance and usage data remains on-device for optimization.
